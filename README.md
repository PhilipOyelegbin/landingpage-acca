# ACCA Landing Page

This project is a frontend assessment task involving the design and development of a modern, responsive landing page for **ACCA (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants)**.

The landing page was designed and built to demonstrate design thinking, frontend development skills, code quality, and deployment practices. The reference page below was used strictly as a **content and structure guide**, not for direct design replication:
